Net::IRR::Cache provides a way to cache data from IRR databases and allows for
small local modifications like adding or removing single prefixes from IRR data.

Data is looked up for a given RPSL expression. The result is a list of AS
numbers and route (or route6) objects contained in a given RPSL expression. The
data can be further filtered by suplying ASes and routes to add or delete from
IRR data in a YAML exception file. Finally data can be stored in a YAML data
file for later use.

To simplify reading cached IRR data as much as possible a Net::IRR::Read
module is also provided.

Fetching data from IRR is implemented via peval from IRRtoolset mantained by ISC
and can be obtained at:
